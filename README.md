# ðŸš€ I'm excited to share my latest project: a native Android chatbot application developed using Kotlin and XML!

## In this app, users can engage in a conversation with a chatbot, entering prompts and receiving responses in real time. Itâ€™s a great tool for enhancing user interaction and providing instant support.

### This project has allowed me to deepen my skills in Android development, user interface design, and natural language processing. Iâ€™m looking forward to exploring more possibilities in AI and app development!
